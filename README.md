## QUIC, zig server


This is a personal project with the objective of making a QUIC server in zig, to practice 
and study socket communication at a low level and also the recent QUIC protocol.
I am open to any help, contributions and recommendation, I would like it if the project can grow in a community that can be built around it. 

As of now the progress will be really slow as I am learning the basics, but I will organize it better and use good practice so the project is more modular and can grow. 

For now the objective will be to be able to do the *1-RTT Hand-shake*, with a client implemented with a well supported library in other languages.
