Here we got a problem apparently, there is not that many vlogs explainin QUIC to a very low level, therefore what is left is the actual documentation.
I wont take notes about all, but only the relevant parts.

# QUIC: A UDP-Based Multiplexed and Secure Transport

QUIC is a connection-oriented protocol that creates a stateful interaction (stateful means you keep information about the client between requests).
QUIC integrates the TLS handshake, packets are carried in UDP datagram, exchange is over streams connections, bidirectional streams, allow both endpoints to send data,
uniderectional streams, single endpoints to send data. Credit-based shceme limit stream creation and amount of data that can be send

QUIC implements an alghorithm for detecting and recovering loss of data, depends on congeestion control. 

## Streams

Streams can be created by sending data, to manage you also have ending, cancelling and managing flow control.
Any number of streams can operate concurrently, and for an arbitrary amount of data to be sent on any stream.

Streams are identify by stream ID, 62-bit unsigend integer, must not be reused within a connection

- bit(0x01) identifies the initiator of stream, clien-initiated 0 (even number stream ID), server-initiated 1 (Odd number stream ID)

- bit(0x02) distinguishes between bidirectional streams 0, unidirectional 1

0x00 client,bidirectional
0x01 server, bidirectional
0x02 client, unidirectional
0x03 server, unidirectional
