So what should i do? in any case first i need the socket and file descriptor, so first is that
# Day 1

1. how to manage the file descriptors?

I need and "object" in this case a struct that represents my server, no problem with that, but also for each connection and the listen
i would have a file descriptor, so i must find a way to manage file descriptor - connection.

So the LLM, says it is actually very simple, a plane bitmap, where each bit represents if that FD is activated or not, the size is fix so there
are not any memory problems, but there will be a max of connections it can handle, bit that would be fine. Actually i would like the uint that accepts
the max number of connections to be determine in compilations time, so it can be u8, u16 or u32

- bitmap, compilation time bytes

Afterthoughts: it is like go, in the sense there are no classes, but structs with classes
i wanted to make like a config struct like in fiber go, but in a way the generic strucut
that returns the server function, is that. So it was mostly fighting with the linter in nvim
(i will also use vscode when i am tired), and undestanding a little of zig, tomorrow i would do
the syscalls

i am not done i added an comptime optimizations,the first i did wasnt what i intended, i fixed it, if i can use the min Uint
probably i will, i wont gain much but still is an optimization (probably i wont see the actually important optimizations)
